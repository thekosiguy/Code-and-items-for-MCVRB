To get the program to work download pygame and pygbutton and extract their contents to the site packages folder in your python folder. Also save all images in the same place as "MasterchefVRBH.py". It's not fully complete though, I need to add sound and had trouble saving cropped images because linux is wierd (that's why they dont blend very well with the background). Let me know if you wanna make any changes.
